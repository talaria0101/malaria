/**
 * How the agent asks for a delegation, and how the answer gets back.
 *
 * The agent has no way to call the daemon: it is in a sandbox, and the one
 * place both sides can reach is the session's state directory. So a request is
 * a file there, and the answer is a file beside it. The same channel already
 * carries a pull request, and using it twice beats inventing a second one.
 *
 * The agent runs a command rather than writing the file by hand. A command on
 * its PATH is something a coding agent already knows how to find and use, and
 * it means the request shape is written down in one place instead of being
 * described in a prompt and hoped for.
