/**
 * Scrubs the provider credential out of everything a session reports.
 *
 * The agent authenticates with a key held in its environment, so the key is
 * reachable by the agent by necessity. Anything the agent then prints is
 * forwarded: a tool that dumps the environment, a library that puts a request
 * header in an error, a config file it decides to read out. That output goes
 * to a chat channel, to the web interface, and to the transcript on disk, and
 * a credential posted into a channel has left the machine for good.
 *
 * Wrapping the fan-out rather than each view is what makes this hold: every
 * surface is behind it, including the transcript, so there is no path that
 * reports something the others scrubbed.
 *
 * It replaces the value verbatim. An agent that splits or re-encodes the key
 * defeats it, which is why this is damage control on an unavoidable exposure
 * rather than a boundary.
