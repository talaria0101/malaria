/**
 * One session, presented through any number of surfaces at once.

 * A session reports what it is doing to a {@link ThreadPort}. This is one, and
 * it forwards to every attached view, so a chat thread and a browser are two
 * views of the same session rather than two sessions.
 *
 * It also keeps a bounded record of what was reported, so a view that attaches
 * to a session already in progress is shown what it missed instead of an empty
 * pane. The record holds what was said, not the state around it: state is kept
 * separately and applied as it currently stands, because replaying every queue
 * position a session ever had would be noise rather than history.
